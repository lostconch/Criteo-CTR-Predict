# Criteo-CTR-Predict

Predict click-through rates on display ads

Display advertising is a billion dollar effort and one of the central uses of machine learning on the Internet. However, its data and methods are usually kept under lock and key. In this research competition, CriteoLabs is sharing a weekâ€™s worth of data for you to develop models predicting ad click-through rate (CTR). Given a user and the page he is visiting, what is the probability that he will click on a given ad?

The goal of this project is to benchmark the most accurate ML algorithms for CTR estimation. All winning models will be released under an open source license. As a participant, you are given a chance to access the traffic logs from Criteo that include various undisclosed features along with the click labels. 



File descriptions

train.csv - The training set consists of a portion of Criteo's traffic over a period of 7 days. Each row corresponds to a display ad served by Criteo. Positive (clicked) and negatives (non-clicked) examples have both been subsampled at different rates in order to 

reduce the dataset size. The examples are chronologically ordered.
test.csv - The test set is computed in the same way as the training set but for events on the day following the training period.

random_submission.csv - A sample submission file in the correct format.
Data fields

Label - Target variable that indicates if an ad was clicked (1) or not (0).
I1-I13 - A total of 13 columns of integer features (mostly count features).
C1-C26 - A total of 26 columns of categorical features. The values of these features have been hashed onto 32 bits for anonymization purposes. 

The semantic of the features is undisclosed.

When a value is missing, the field is empty.
